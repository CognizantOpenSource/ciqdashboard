# Contributing guidelines

These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment. Please feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behaviour to [CIQDashboard Support](mailto:IDashboardSupport@cognizant.com).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Sign the CLA

Before you contribute, we first request people to sign a [Contributor License Agreement](Cognizant%20Technology%20Solutions%20Individual%20Contributor%20License%20Agreement.docx) (or CLA). We ask this so that we know contributors can donate the code.

When you open your pull request we ask that you indicate that you've agreed to the CLA. This will reduce the time it takes for us to integrate it.

### Reporting Bugs

* Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.

* Describe your environment - OS Version, Java version, Browsers used and their versions etc.

* Describe the behaviour you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behaviour.

* Check if it is an issue with the third-party libraries used. We will not be able to support issues related to third-party libraries.

* If the issues are related to execution attach the `console.txt` and reports if possible.

* Please attach screenshots and the `log.txt` file to the installation location if you are experiencing issues with the UI.


### Suggest enhancements

* Perform a cursory search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.

* Explain why this enhancement would be useful to the users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a community package.

### Submitting changes

- Make sure to write a clear log message for each commit you make. 
- It is fine to use one-line messages for small changes, but for significant changes, it is best to use the following format:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```
